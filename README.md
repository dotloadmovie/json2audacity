# json2audacity
Builds Audacity labels from JSON object

This is a simple CLI node utility to convert a JSON/JS array of trackname, artist, track duration into meaningful Audacity labels. Handy for splitting long files or handling recorded analogue media.

To run: add track details to `src/data/artists.js` then `npm install` and `npm run app`
